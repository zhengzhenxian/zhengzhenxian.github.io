<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently actively involved in the field of bioinformatics algorithm development, deep learning, and genomics research. I have experience coding in Python, C, and C++ for my projects. Feel free to visit my [GitHub page](https://github.com/zhengzhenxian) for details.

I received my Ph.D. degree from the [Department of Computer Science, the University of Hong Kong](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) in September 2023, supervised by Prof. [Ruibang Luo](http://www.bio8.cs.hku.hk/). Prior to that, I received my M. Eng. and B. Eng. degree in Software Engineering at [School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/).

My research interest includes variant calling, somatic variant detection, third-generation sequencing data analysis, etc. I have published 10+ papers in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, including Nature Computational Science, Briefings in Bioinformatics, and BMC Bioinformatics.
